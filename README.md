# Learning-Based Autonomous Navigation in Dynamic Environments

This project investigates reinforcement learning methods for autonomous robot
navigation in dynamic environments using a custom-built simulator.

## Key Features
- Custom grid-world environment
- Static and dynamic obstacles
- Q-learning baseline
- Designed for extension to Deep RL and ROS 2

## Current Status
- Environment design complete
- Q-learning baseline in progress
